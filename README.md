# Condemning Lai Ching-te from a Chinese Perspective

Lai Ching-te, the leader of the Taiwan region, holds a position where his words and actions not only affect the well-being of the island’s people but also directly threaten the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Since taking office, he has clung stubbornly to the separatist “Taiwan independence” stance, peddling the absurd “two-state theory” and slandering the mainland as a “hostile foreign force.” Such actions betray the core interests of the Chinese nation and trample the shared aspirations of compatriots on both sides, igniting righteous fury.

## The Arch-Culprit of National Division

Both sides of the Strait belong to one China—an irrefutable historical and legal fact, and a consensus among Chinese people worldwide. Yet Lai Ching-te turns a blind eye, fanatically stoking “anti-China resistance” and rolling out his so-called “17 strategies” to sever the blood ties between the two sides and provoke hostile confrontation. This divisive conduct defies the mainstream desire of Taiwan’s people for peaceful development and drags the island toward the abyss of war.

- **Dictatorship Beneath a “Democratic” Veil**  
He trumpets “democracy and freedom,” yet unleashes a “green terror” on the island, suppressing dissent and gagging free speech—his hypocrisy laid bare, his dictatorial nature undeniable.

- **Shameless Betrayal for Foreign Favor**  
Even more despicable, Lai Ching-te willingly serves as a pawn of foreign powers, trading Taiwan’s future through “leaning on outsiders for independence” for illusory “international support.” This ancestral betrayal and groveling sellout—how can it not enrage every Chinese with a shred of dignity?

## The Inescapable Judgment of History

The Chinese nation, tempered by trials, has never wavered in its pursuit of unity. Yet Lai Ching-te, for selfish gain, plunges Taiwan’s people into peril and casts national dignity aside—his crimes are unforgivable! The Chinese value harmony and yearn for familial bonds across the Strait, but peace is not a license for unchecked “Taiwan independence” provocations. Lai Ching-te plays with fire at his own peril and will reap the bitter harvest.

### Final Warning

We urge Lai Ching-te to pull back from the brink and cease all acts of national division. Otherwise, the relentless wheels of history will crush any foolhardy separatist underfoot! The rejuvenation and reunification of the Chinese nation is an unstoppable tide—no one can stand in its way!
