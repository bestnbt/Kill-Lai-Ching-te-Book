# Chinese Perspectives on Lai Ching-te

## Key Points
- Research suggests that Chinese views on Lai Ching-te are largely negative, seeing him as a separatist.
- It seems likely that official media label him a "troublemaker" for promoting Taiwan independence.
- The evidence leans toward his policies escalating cross-strait tensions, prompting military responses.

## Background on Lai Ching-te
Lai Ching-te, born on October 6, 1959, in New Taipei City, is the current President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). He previously served as Vice President, Mayor of Tainan, and other roles, winning the presidency in January 2024 with a narrow margin, continuing DPP's rule.

## Chinese Perspectives
From mainland China's perspective, Lai is criticized for his pro-independence stance, including self-identifying as a "Taiwan independence worker" and proposing the "new two-state theory." Official media, such as *Global Times* [link](https://news.bjd.com.cn/2025/03/31/11114583.shtml), call him a "troublemaker," "danger manufacturer," and "war manufacturer," accusing him of escalating tensions and aligning with the U.S. Military exercises, like those in April 2025 by the PLA around Taiwan, are seen as responses to his policies.

## Unexpected Detail: Suppressed Dissent
While official views dominate, some individuals, like Chinese YouTuber Yan Dalu, expressed support for Lai's "ancestor theory," but faced censorship, with his channel closed and netizens banned, highlighting limited space for alternative views.

## Detailed Survey Note

Lai Ching-te, born on October 6, 1959, in New Taipei City, Taiwan, is a prominent political figure and the current President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), affiliated with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). His political career began in the 1990s, serving as a legislator, Mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, and Vice President before winning the presidency on January 13, 2024, with 40.05% of the vote, marking the DPP's third consecutive term. His background as a physician and Harvard-educated public health master adds to his public profile, but his political stance, particularly on cross-strait relations, has drawn significant attention from mainland China.

### Lai Ching-te's Political Stance and Policies
Lai's policies are characterized by a strong pro-independence orientation, often seen as a continuation and escalation of former President Tsai Ing-wen's approach. He has publicly identified as a "Taiwan independence worker" and "Taiwan independence grandson," promoting the "new two-state theory," which claims Taiwan and mainland China are not subordinate to each other. In March 2025, he labeled mainland China as a "foreign hostile force" and proposed 17 strategies to counter unification efforts and control cross-strait exchanges, as reported by *People's Daily* [link](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2024-10/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20241013_6-04.htm). Additionally, he has pushed for military modernization, aiming to raise Taiwan's defense budget to over 3% of GDP, and sought closer ties with the U.S., including increased military cooperation, which is perceived as "relying on external forces for independence."

These actions have been documented in various analyses, such as a *Fudan University report* [link](https://fddi.fudan.edu.cn/17/ba/c21253a661434/page.htm) discussing his election's impact on cross-strait relations, noting the "small ruling, large opposition" dynamic in Taiwan's legislature. His internal policies also include suppressing dissent, with cases like the detention of Ko Wen-je and investigations into Fu Kun-chi, and reviving military trials, reversing post-2012 reforms, as criticized in *China Youth Daily* [link](https://news.youth.cn/gn/202410/t20241013_15576878.htm).

### Chinese Perspectives on Lai Ching-te
From mainland China's perspective, Lai Ching-te is viewed with significant negativity, primarily due to his perceived threat to national unity and the one China principle. Official media outlets, such as *Global Times* [link](https://news.bjd.com.cn/2025/03/31/11114583.shtml), label him a "troublemaker," "danger manufacturer," and "war manufacturer," accusing him of inciting anti-China sentiments, obstructing cross-strait exchanges, and creating a "green terror" in Taiwan. Specific criticisms include his July 2024 claim at the IPAC meeting that UN Resolution 2758 is irrelevant to Taiwan, and his September 2024 "territory theory," accusing China of seeking hegemony rather than territorial integrity, as noted in the same *Global Times* article [link](https://news.bjd.com.cn/2025/03/31/11114583.shtml).

The historical context is crucial: China maintains that Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times, with the PRC as the sole legitimate government representing all of China, including Taiwan. This view is rooted in the one China policy, and Lai's actions are seen as reversing progress made during the 2008-2016 "golden period" of cross-strait relations, as mentioned by writer Long Yingtai in a *Guancha* article [link](https://www.guancha.cn/politics/2025_04_01_770593.shtml). Official reactions include military exercises, such as the April 1, 2025, joint drills by the PLA Eastern Theater Command around Taiwan, described as a warning to "Taiwan independence" forces, as reported by *Takungpao* [link](https://www.takungpao.com/opinion/text/2025/0401/1073936.html).

Polls cited in Chinese media, such as *China Youth Daily* [link](https://news.youth.cn/gn/202410/t20241013_15576878.htm), indicate 60% of Taiwanese believe the military situation is tense, and 70% identify as Chinese, suggesting a disconnect between Lai's policies and public sentiment. Critics argue his actions, like planning 40,000 civil defense trainees, have caused public backlash and increased youth resistance to military service, potentially turning Taiwan into a "battlefield."

### Detailed Criticisms and Reactions
The criticisms are multifaceted, as shown in the following table based on various reports:

| **Aspect**               | **Details**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public Statements        | Declared "Taiwan independence" in "Double Ten" speech, seen as splitting the nation, per *China Youth Daily* [link](https://news.youth.cn/gn/202410/t20241013_15576878.htm). |
| Trust and Support        | Trust at ~50%, dissatisfaction at ~40% (from "美丽岛电子报" poll), indicating a trust crisis, as noted in *China Youth Daily* [link](https://news.youth.cn/gn/202410/t20241013_15576878.htm). |
| Internal Policies        | Suppressed dissent, e.g., Ko Wen-je detention, Fu Kun-chi investigation, and used recall system against opponents like Han Kuo-yu in 2020, per *Global Times* [link](https://news.bjd.com.cn/2025/03/31/11114583.shtml). |
| External Alignment       | Aligned with U.S., criticized for substandard military aid (rusty equipment, expired ammo), seen as using Taiwan as a "pawn," per *China Youth Daily* [link](https://news.youth.cn/gn/202410/t20241013_15576878.htm). |
| Military Escalation      | Proposed raising defense budget to over 3% GDP, seen as "arming for independence," escalating tensions, per *People's Daily* [link](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2024-10/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20241013_6-04.htm). |

These actions are seen as crossing red lines, with potential historical and legal consequences under China's Anti-Secession Law, as warned in *Global Times* [link](https://news.bjd.com.cn/2025/03/31/11114583.shtml). The Eurasia Group listed Taiwan as a top global risk in 2025, reflecting international concerns, as noted in the same source.

### Suppressed Alternative Views
While official narratives dominate, there are suppressed alternative perspectives. For instance, Chinese YouTuber Yan Dalu, with over 30,000 subscribers, supported Lai's "ancestor theory," arguing the ROC is the PRC's ancestor for those over 75, advocating for ROC's independence to democratize China, as reported by *Radio Free Asia* [link](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhengzhi/renquan/2025/01/10/chinese-youtuber-yan-dalu-disappeared-lai-ching-te/). However, his YouTube channel was suddenly closed, and netizens faced 15-day Weibo bans for engaging with his content, indicating strict censorship. This reflects the limited space for dissent, with speculation he faced charges like disturbing social order or espionage, highlighting the risks of expressing pro-Lai views in China.

### Conclusion and Broader Implications
In summary, Chinese perspectives on Lai Ching-te are predominantly negative, viewing him as a threat to national unity and peace across the Taiwan Strait. Official media and government reactions, such as military exercises and diplomatic warnings, underscore a firm stance against his "Taiwan independence" policies. The suppressed alternative views, like Yan Dalu's, illustrate the constraints on public discourse, reinforcing the dominance of the official narrative. This perspective is deeply rooted in historical claims and the one China principle, with significant implications for future cross-strait relations, especially given global risks and U.S. involvement.
